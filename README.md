## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

- Started working on the HTML of the page, stablishing all the elements according to the design provided.
- Once the HTML was done, I started to work with the CSS to style the page according to what was provided as design.
- I started with Desktop First, then I moved to a mobile media query.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

The major learning here was to use the tag `picture` to change the Perfume photography according to the user's device.

```html
<picture>
          <source srcset="images/image-product-mobile.jpg" media="(max-width: 375px)">
          <img src="images/image-product-desktop.jpg" alt="Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum">
        </picture>
```
```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {

    .content {
        flex-direction: column;
        width: auto;
        height: auto;
        margin: 1rem;
    }
    
    .item-photo picture {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        object-fit: cover;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

Still want to continue to progress using FlexBox and to understand better without consulting online.
